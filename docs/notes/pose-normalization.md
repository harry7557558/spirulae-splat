# Pose normalization: orientation, centering, scale, and train_frame

`orientation_method`, `center_method` and `auto_scale_poses` are accepted by
both trainers but only *partially* implemented natively. This note records
what the C++ does, what it does not, and where the reference implementation
is, so the port does not have to be reverse-engineered from a diff.

## Status

| config | native behaviour |
|---|---|
| `orientation_method` | always `up`; anything else warns and is approximated |
| `center_method` | always `poses`; ditto |
| `auto_scale_poses` | effectively always on — the scale is folded into `train_frame_scale` |
| `train_frame` | only `points`; `normalized` / `camera` are rejected by `check_config()` |

Because `train_frame="points"` keeps splats in the raw SfM frame, the
orientation/centering choice does **not** move the training coordinates. It
only changes `train_frame_scale` (and hence the LR / regularizer rescaling
that hangs off it) and `train_to_normalized`, the similarity the web viewer
uses to place its default camera. That is why the native trainer can warn and
carry on rather than refuse: the approximation is real but bounded.

`src/data/parsers/DatasetCommon.cpp::compute_normalized_transform` is the C++
side. It implements the `up`/`poses` path only.

## Reference implementation

- `spirulae_splat/modules/camera_utils.py` — the algorithms
  (`auto_orient_and_center_poses` for pca/up/vertical/none x poses/focus/none,
  `orient_and_center_poses_gsplat` for the `gsplat` value of both). That module
  is on no code path; it exists for this.
- The call site below — how those outputs become `transform_matrix`,
  `scale_factor`, `train_frame_scale` and `train_to_normalized_transform`.
  This half is at least as fiddly as the algorithms, and it is the part a
  reimplementation is most likely to get subtly wrong.

## The original call site

Verbatim from `spirulae_splat/modules/dataparser.py::_parse_nerfstudio_data`
at commit `af96993`, the last commit before the Python parser was deleted
(`git show af96993:spirulae_splat/modules/dataparser.py` for the full file).
Reproduced rather than paraphrased so it cannot drift from what was actually
verified against the native parser.

## Notes for whoever ports this

- `transform_matrix_scale` (the cube root of the rotation block's determinant)
  is divided out of the transform and folded into `scale_factor`. The gsplat
  path returns a non-unit-determinant matrix; the up/poses path does not, so
  this is a no-op there. Getting it wrong scales the whole scene.
- The `gsplat` branch sets `scale_factor = 1 / scene_scale` and carries a
  `# TODO: this messes up scale_reg` comment from before `train_frame_scale`
  existed. Worth re-checking rather than porting the comment.
- `train_frame="points"` additionally undoes nerfstudio's `applied_transform`
  so poses and points land back in the original SfM frame. The native parser
  does implement this (`NerfstudioParser.cpp`); it is only the
  orientation/centering *choice* that is missing.
- The `train_frame_scale = 1 / scale_factor` relationship is what the engine
  uses to rescale `means_lr`, `scale_reg`, `max_world_size` and `noise_lr`.
  A port that changes `scale_factor` changes effective learning rates.
