# Fail when a comment points at a file that is not in the tree.
#
# Comments rot silently: a path or a filename cited in prose is not compiled,
# not tested, and survives every rename. This repo has had both failure modes
# at once -- citations into a deleted Python trainer (`model.py:547-559`) that
# nobody could check, and a `scripts/mask.py` that had moved to
# `reference/scripts/` and was still printed to users in 13 languages.
#
# Two rules, both deliberately narrow so a hit is always a real defect:
#
#   1. A QUALIFIED path (one containing `/`, e.g. `src/mesh/MeshUV.cpp`) must
#      resolve to a tracked file. It resolves if it matches a tracked path
#      outright, under `src/` (the include root), or as the tail of one -- so
#      the repo's usual shorthand (`backend/vulkan/README.md`,
#      `shaders/meshing.slang`) still passes.
#   2. A BARE `<name>.py` must name some tracked file. Upstream scripts we
#      only reference are listed in EXTERNAL_PY.
#
# URLs, third-party include roots and `./`-relative forms are skipped.
# See the "Comments" section of AGENTS.md for what the rules are protecting.
#
