// Prompt-to-mask policy, shared by ssam-cli and ssam-extract.
//
// This is the semantic layer scripts/mask.py implements in
// Python, kept in one place so the two tools cannot drift:
//
//   * several positive phrases, semicolon separated, unioned;
//   * negative phrases carved back out -- a region matching one is KEPT even
//     when it also matches a positive phrase;
//   * the output mask says what to KEEP, so by default the prompted objects
//     come out black and everything else white. `keep_prompted` flips that,
//     for the case where the prompt names the subject rather than a distractor;
//   * a longest-side cap on what the model sees, with the mask returned at the
//     source resolution.
//
// It also covers the visual path, where there is no text at all and instances
// are seeded from clicks -- see SeedPrompt.

// Two things follow from SAM's design and both are load-bearing here. Objects
// are SEPARATE: a model prompted with a click on the dog and a click on the
// bicycle returns one mask that fits neither, so each object gets its own id
// and its own tracked instance, and the masks are unioned afterwards. And a
// click belongs to the FRAME it was drawn on: pointing at (900, 500) says
// nothing about frame 400 of a moving capture, which is why this carries a
// frame rather than being applied to all of them.
//
// Several seeds sharing an `object` refine one instance as the capture goes
// on: the first is what starts the track, the rest are corrections at the
// frames where it drifted. That is exactly the SAM 2 conditioning-frame model.
