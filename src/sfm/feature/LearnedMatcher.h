// The matcher seam: LightGlue behind IFeatureMatcher, and the factory that
// picks between it and the GPU brute-force matcher.
//
// sfm/feature/Matcher.h always said a learned matcher would implement that
// interface; this is it. What the interface does NOT carry, and what callers
// therefore have to know, is cost: brute force is ~3.5 ms for a pair, LightGlue
// is tens of milliseconds, because it runs nine transformer layers over both
// images' keypoints. It belongs behind pair selection and nowhere else --
// `--pairs exhaustive` with `--matcher lightglue` on a thousand images is half
// a million pairs and several hours.
//
// Like Extractor.h, nothing here may include an aliked/ header: src/sfm/ builds
// without the inference layer, and the factory says so at run time.
