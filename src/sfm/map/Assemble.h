// Turning a set of models into reconstructions (D57, D63).
//
// Two mappers produce that set and from there they need the identical thing.
// The flat one seeds, grows until nothing else registers, and seeds again among
// what is left (D41); the bottom-up one cuts the view graph into atoms and
// reconstructs them concurrently (sfm/map/Bottomup.h). Either way what comes
// out is several models that overlap in places, and the rest of the work is:
//
//   * merge the ones that belong together, checking each result against
//     evidence the merge itself never used (ModelOps.h's seam validator);
//   * grow the ones that did not merge, because merging cannot invent overlap
//     that is not there and registration is the only operation that creates it;
//   * optimize what changed, so the next round judges a settled model;
//   * and once at the end, do what no amount of merging can: break a model its
//     own correspondences contradict, cut a fold, register the tail, seed among
//     whatever nothing reached.
//
// The first three are a *level*, and levels repeat until one stops changing
// anything. That is a merge tree when the input is hundreds of atoms and two or
// three rounds when it is the flat mapper's handful of components -- the same
// loop either way, which is why it is here and not in either mapper.
//
// This replaced the manage loop (D44), which drove the same operations in
// rounds but re-ran the expensive ones over models nothing had touched, and
// whose repair pass grew every model it repaired without a bound: on a
// 5356-image capture it spent 65 minutes to merge three models and recover 119
// images, ending with three near-copies of the same reconstruction.
