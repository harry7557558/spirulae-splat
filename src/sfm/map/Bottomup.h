// Bottom-up reconstruction: many small models, merged upwards (D57).
//
// The flat mapper builds one large model first and only then discovers what it
// could not reach, so its expensive whole-model passes (global BA,
// retriangulation, filtering) all run at full size, and every repair runs at
// full size too.
//
// This turns the schedule around. The view graph is cut into *atoms* of around
// a hundred images (sfm/map/Partition.h), each reconstructed by the ordinary
// incremental mapper and all of them concurrently (sfm/map/Atoms.h) -- at that
// size its passes are trivial, its failure modes are local, and the atoms are
// independent. From there it is the shared schedule in sfm/map/Assemble.h:
// merge levels with growth and a joint solve between them, then the finishing
// passes. This file is the part that is actually bottom-up -- the cut, the
// atoms, and the one joint refinement that gives them a common gauge before
// any of them are merged.
//
// Two things make the merging work where a single pass over the flat mapper's
// output does not, and both are set up here:
//
//   * **Shared intrinsics throughout.** Every model in flight is bundle-
//     adjusted in one problem with the intrinsics shared per camera group
//     (Mapper::jointRefine). A forty-image atom cannot determine its own focal
//     and must not try; when each model keeps its own answer, the merger is
//     asked to align two reconstructions of the same place in two different
//     gauges, and the pixel-space tests it uses to accept a merge are exactly
//     what that breaks. There is nothing to average at merge time because
//     nothing ever diverged.
//   * **Overlap by construction.** Neighbouring atoms share images
//     (PartitionOptions::overlap), and that overlap is what the first Sim(3)
//     aligns on. Two atoms with nothing in common can only be joined by
//     growth, which is the slow path.

    // doubling the atom size does. Overlap below min_part on purpose: it is
    // what keeps a cut part strictly smaller than what it was cut from (see
    // bisect).
    //
    // 48 is small, and deliberately so. A model pays a fixed number of bundle
    // adjustments as it grows, so a small atom is *less* efficient per image,
    // not more: at 48 the partition asks for 2.1-2.4x as many image-slots as
    // the capture has, and 96 brings that to ~1.4x and the whole run 1.2-2.1x
    // faster. That was tried and reverted. On a 798-image capture, 96 put half
    // the reconstruction half a scene-extent from where it belonged -- with
    // *more* images registered and a better median rotation error than the flat
    // mapper, which is the signature of a fold. On a 1322-image one it left six
    // fragments where 48 left one large model.
    //
    // What makes that worth 40 % of the run time is that nothing else fixed it,
    // and the failure is silent. A stricter merge threshold did not (12 shared
    // images instead of 3: unchanged). Tightening the tree's bundle adjustments
    // did not. Splitting the atoms first did not -- neither by their own
    // contradicted pairs nor by the fold detector, both of which found *nothing*
    // in any atom. And the cross-seam test ran on all fifteen merges and refused
    // one, so the weld went through a test built to catch exactly this.
