// The gauge a finished model is written in.
//
// A monocular reconstruction has no absolute orientation, position or scale --
// the mapper's answer is whatever the seed pair happened to be, so a capture
// of a level room comes out tilted at a random angle, centred on nothing in
// particular, and sized in units of "however far apart those first two frames
// were". Everything downstream then has to carry that: the trainer computes a
// normalizing similarity to place its viewer camera, the web viewer applies it
// again, and an exported splat.ply or mesh -- which carries no cameras and so
// no way to recover the transform -- is simply tilted forever.
//
// Fixing the gauge here, once, at the point where the model is written, gives
// every consumer an upright, centred, unit-sized scene for free.
//
// The transform is the SAME one the trainer computes from the poses it loads
// (dsparse::compute_normalized_transform, orientation_method="up" /
// center_method="poses" / auto_scale_poses):
//
//     up     = normalize(mean camera up axis)
//     R      = the rotation taking `up` to +Z
//     centre = mean camera position
//     scale  = 1 / max component of R (position - centre) over all cameras
//
// Two consequences worth knowing. The trainer's own normalization becomes a
// near-identity, so `train_frame_scale` comes out ~1 and the learning-rate and
// regularizer rescaling that hangs off it no longer has anything to undo --
// the training frame IS the normalized frame. And a fragmented capture
// normalizes each component separately, which is correct because separate
// components share no gauge to begin with; a later `merge` estimates the Sim3
// between them regardless.
//
// "Up" is a statistical claim about how the capture was held, not a
// measurement -- a camera carried upside-down through half a capture gives a
// mean up axis pointing at neither. It is the same claim the trainer has
// always made, and `--no-orient` is how to decline it.
