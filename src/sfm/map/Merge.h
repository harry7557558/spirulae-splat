// Reconstruction merging -- COLMAP's `model_merger` (docs/notes/sfm-design.md D43).
//
// A capture that is not one connected view graph reconstructs as several models
// (D41), each in its own gauge. Two models that registered some of the same
// images can still be fused: those shared images give the similarity transform
// (rotation, translation, scale) between the two worlds, and everything else
// follows -- poses are transformed, tracks that meet at a shared feature are
// spliced, tracks that do not become new points.
//
// Three pieces, deliberately separable because a GUI will drive them
// individually (spirulae-splat's model viewer, where a user says "merge this
// one into that one" or supplies the transform themselves):
//
//   alignReconstructions()  shared images -> Sim3, by RANSAC over image
//                           centers scored in *pixels* (a candidate transform
//                           predicts each shared image's pose; the residual is
//                           how far the other model's points then reproject).
//   mergeInto()             mechanical: apply a Sim3, splice tracks, filter.
//   MergeSession            the policy: which pairs to try, in what order,
//                           and what to do when one turns out badly.
//
// Failure handling mirrors the mapper's (D36): a merge is attempted on a copy,
// validated, and committed only if the result is sound -- a bad alignment
// leaves the models exactly as they were, the pair is remembered as failed, and
// the search moves on. A later successful merge revives those pairs, because a
// model that has grown may now share enough with the one it could not reach.
//
// Requirement inherited from COLMAP: both models must come from the same
// features, so that in a shared image `point2D_idx` means the same keypoint in
// both. Violations are detected (name / keypoint-count mismatch on a shared
// id) and refused rather than merged into garbage.

// ---- duplicate structure (D45) -------------------------------------------
//
// The failure no other test here catches. A capture that walks past two
// similar-looking parts of a building -- two wings of a symmetric facade, two
// identical corridors -- produces matches between them that are perfectly
// self-consistent, so every check based on the model's own agreement passes.
// The result is a *fold*: two physically different places written on top of
// each other, one of them typically rotated.
//
// What gives it away is what is *missing*. If the model puts two images in the
// same place looking the same way, they are looking at the same thing, and a
// reconstruction that believed that would have triangulated the same points
// from both. Measured over co-located, co-oriented image pairs of that model:
// pairs on the same side of the fold share a median of 454 points, pairs
// across it share 0 (73% share fewer than 5). A model with no fold has no such
// pairs at all.
//
// This is the "missing correspondences" signal of the duplicate-structure
// literature (Heinly et al.), computed from the reconstruction alone.

// "Have these two images been matched to each other, with real support?" --
// supplied by whoever holds the correspondence graph (the mapper does; the
// merger does not). Without it the test below misfires: a densely captured
// room has plenty of co-located images that share no *point ids* simply
// because their tracks were split, and calling those a fold cut drjohnson's
// sound 261-image model into 144+96+20. Two images that really are the same
