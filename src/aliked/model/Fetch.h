// The artifacts are COLMAP's, fetched from COLMAP's release URLs and verified
// against COLMAP's SHA-256. Nothing is
// bundled, nothing is committed, and nothing of ours is hosted anywhere -- so
// there is no converter to keep in step with an upstream re-export, and the
// bytes we run are the bytes the reference implementation runs.
//
// Both models are permissively licensed -- ALIKED is BSD-3-Clause, LightGlue
// Apache-2.0 -- so unlike the segmentation checkpoints
// (src/app/gui/ModelCache.cpp) this needs no consent gate. It still never
// downloads behind the user's back: `spirula sfm` prints what it is fetching
// and from where, and --aliked-model points at a file instead.
