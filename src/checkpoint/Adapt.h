// Checkpoint layout adaptation: rewrite a checkpoint's saved buffers to a
// layout different from the one they were written at, so training can resume
// with fewer Gaussians, a different SH degree, or with/without bilagrid/PPISP.
// The result is an ordinary state.tar that the unchanged (exact-match)
// engine_load_checkpoint() then loads.
//
// Everything runs on the host, buffer at a time -- the motivating case is
// resuming a run that just ran out of VRAM, so the adaptation cannot need any.
// Quantized buffers are decoded and re-encoded through the engine's own codecs
// in core/Tensor.h, not a copy of them.
//
// Splat reduction policy (target count = min(cur_ckpt, max_new)):
//   1. drop the tail (newest splats) by up to the checkpoint's unsaturated
//      slack (max_ckpt - cur_ckpt), then
//   2. drop the rest by lowest opacity.
