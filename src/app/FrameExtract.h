// FrameExtract -- video in, a folder of sharp (optionally masked) frames out.
//
// The composition of src/video/ (decode + a sharpness shader) and src/sam/
// (masking), driven identically by `spirula-sam extract` and by the GUI's
// dataset preparation, so the two cannot drift. It sits in src/app/ for the
// same reason TrainerCore does: it belongs to neither subsystem, and every
// front end wants exactly one copy of it.
//
// The frame-selection arithmetic reproduces
// reference/scripts/extract_frames.py's -- a window of `keep` frames, one
// written every `skip` -- so the same source frames get the same file names
// whichever path produced them. That is what lets the GUI fall back to
// ffmpeg + FrameSelect without the dataset changing.
//
// Only compiled when SS_ENABLE_PATENTED is ON; every caller has an ffmpeg
// fallback for when it is not.
