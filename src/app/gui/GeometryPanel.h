//
// The same predictor and the same app::GeometryWarp the run uses, so what is
// on screen is what will be written -- including the split into pinhole faces
// a wide lens gets, which is the part that comes out plausible and wrong when
// the lens was described wrongly. It also answers "how long will this take",
// which at a second an image is the question nobody can afford to guess.
//
// The model lives on the GPU while the panel is open and is dropped when it
// closes; a run that follows should not share VRAM with it.
