// MatchMatrix -- which images matched which, as a picture.
//
// The one thing about matching that a progress bar cannot say. A capture shot
// as a walk gives a bright diagonal band; a walk that came back on itself and
// closed the loop gives corners as well, and a capture that did NOT close shows
// the band alone -- which is exactly the failure that turns into a
// reconstruction in two pieces, and the reason the sequential pairing has a
// loop-closure switch at all.
//
// Fed live from the run's progress directory while matching, and from its
// matches.bin afterwards (SfmProgress.h).
