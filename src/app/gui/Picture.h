// Picture -- one dataset image in memory, with its mask composited in, at the
// size the screen is about to draw it.
//
// That size is the whole point. A copy smaller than the pane is upscaled into
// it, which is exactly what "blurry" looks like; a 4K copy in a 900-pixel pane
// is minified by a 2x2 tap, which is what "noisy" looks like -- and a mipmap
// would not help, because the ImGui backend binds its own LINEAR sampler over
// whatever the texture asks for. So the resampling happens here, on a worker
// thread, with a box filter, once per picture.
