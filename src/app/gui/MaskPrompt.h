// The mask prompt is written in English, always. This is the UI that makes
// that reasonable for someone who does not write English.
//
// SAM 3's text encoder is trained on English. A prompt in another language
// still returns *something* -- which is the dangerous part, because it looks
// like it worked -- but it finds noticeably less of what it names, and the
// user only discovers that after a masking run over the whole capture. So the
// prompt box does not follow the interface language:
//
//   - the box and its placeholder example stay English (ui::InputTextEnglish)
//   - a line under it says so, in the interface language
//   - and this palette gives the twenty or so subjects that account for most
//     real prompts, LABELLED in the interface language, INSERTING English
//
// A user who reads only Japanese can therefore build "person; car; my shadow"
// without writing a word of English, and can still type into the box if they
// want something the palette does not have.
//
// The chips toggle: clicking one that is already in the prompt takes it out,
// and a chip whose term is present is drawn highlighted, so the palette also
// reads as a summary of what the prompt currently says.
