// SplatViewer -- a FILE open for looking at, with no dataset and no training
// behind it: a 3DGS model, an SfM point cloud, or an extracted triangle mesh.
// What it turns out to be decides which renderer draws it; opening it is the
// same action either way, which is what makes "drop a file on the window" work.
//
// Splats go into an ENGINE SCENE SLOT (Engine.h "Viewer scenes"), not into the
// engine's one world, so several of these can be open at once. Taking the
// engine over is the owner's job (CompareView); this only fills and frees a
// slot. Detach anything rendering from it BEFORE close().
//
// Loading runs on a worker thread: a large model is a few hundred MB of PLY.
