// PairPreview -- the two images behind a cell of the match map, with the
// features found on them and the matches that survived between them.
//
// The map says whether two views matched; this says what that meant. A pair
// whose matches all sit on one wall, or on the moving thing the mask was
// supposed to remove, will register badly, and no count of inliers shows it.
//
// It draws whatever of the run's files are there: during matching, keypoints
// and no matches yet; after a run has swept its intermediates away, only the
// pictures. Loading is on its own thread and the latest request wins, so
// sweeping the cursor across the map costs one load, not one per cell.
