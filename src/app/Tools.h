#pragma once

// The tools this program is made of, and the entry point of each.
//
// Everything ships as one executable (`spirula`), which dispatches on its first
// argument -- `spirula sfm auto ...`, `spirula train ...`, `spirula` on its own
// for the window. One file is easier to install, to put on a PATH and to copy
// onto another machine than five, and it is what lets the GUI run a
// reconstruction as a child process without depending on a sibling binary
// being present: it re-runs itself.
//
// Each entry point below is what used to be a `main`, unchanged apart from the
// name, and each still works entirely on its own -- nothing here initializes
// anything for anything else. A build with SS_BUILD_GUI off produces a
// pure command-line binary that needs no display and no GL.
//
// Which of these exist is decided at compile time by the SS_TOOL_* macros
// the build sets; see cmake/SsApps.cmake.
