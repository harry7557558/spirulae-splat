// A one-function host thread helper.
//
// The GPU does the model; the host still resizes a frame, thresholds a mask and
// fills holes, and at 1008x1008x3 in double precision that resize alone is a
// tenth of a frame's budget. Those loops are embarrassingly parallel over rows,
// which is all this covers -- there is no task graph here and no need for one.
//
// Threads are spawned per call. At a handful of calls per frame the ~50 us that
// costs is far below the work being split; a persistent pool would buy nothing
// and would have to be shut down cleanly across the library boundary.
