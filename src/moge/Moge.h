// MoGe-2 monocular geometry: one image in, metric depth, surface normals and a
// validity mask out.
//
// The public surface of src/moge/. Two conventions are worth stating because
// getting either wrong is silent:
//
//   * The input must be a PINHOLE image, as for src/metric3d/. app/GeometryWarp.h
//     is how a distorted camera reaches this.
//   * The network predicts an AFFINE point map -- correct up to one unknown
//     z shift -- plus a metric scale. `depth` is what comes out after both are
//     resolved, in metres. Resolving the shift needs the camera's focal length;
//     without one it is recovered from the point map and is a guess.
