// What the meshing pipeline says while it runs, in the language the user
// picked.
//
// `spirula mesh` is not a third-party tool whose output we pass through: it is
// this program, and when the GUI runs it as a child process (with --lang) the
// lines land in the GUI's terminal panel, read by the person who chose the
// language. So every line goes through here and comes out as
//
//     [meshing] <stage>: <message>
//
// with all three parts translated -- see i18n/catalog/Mesh.h.
//
// The GUI's progress bar reads that shape back (src/app/gui/MeshRunner.cpp).
// It does NOT match English: it compares the stage against the very
// `msg::mesh::stage_*` entries printed here, and pulls counts out of the
// bodies with i18n::scan(), which matches a line against the message it came
// from. That is why this file exposes stage_label() and tag_prefix() as inline
// helpers -- the runner builds exactly the same strings without linking the
// meshing module.
//
// What stays as it is: paths, file names, numbers, and the moment dumps behind
// the debug hooks. out_raw() is for those, named so that using it is a visible
// decision, as ui::*Raw is in the GUI.
