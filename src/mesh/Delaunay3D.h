/*
 * Delaunay3D.h
 *
 * Self-contained, multithreaded 3D Delaunay triangulation.
 *
 * This is a standalone port of geogram's parallel 3D Delaunay
 * (GEO::ParallelDelaunay3d, src/lib/geogram/delaunay/parallel_delaunay_3d.{h,cpp}),
 * including the pieces it depends on (cavity, per-cell atomic status array,
 * BRIO/Hilbert spatial sort, geometric predicates and a small std::thread based
 * thread pool). It has NO external dependency other than the C++ standard
 * library, so it can be compiled on its own (the two files Delaunay3D.{h,cpp}).
 *
 * Original algorithm: Bruno Levy / Inria (geogram), based on ideas of
 * Bowyer-Watson incremental insertion with spatial reordering. See the
 * copyright notice in Delaunay3D.cpp.
