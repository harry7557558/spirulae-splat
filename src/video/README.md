# Video decoding (`src/video/`)

Video decoding without ffmpeg, on top of `src/nn/`'s Vulkan runtime: the pixels
come out of `VK_KHR_video_decode_*` and everything the driver will not do for
itself — containers, bitstream parsing, reference picture management — is here.

**Compiled only with `-DSS_ENABLE_PATENTED=ON`, which is OFF by default.**
The H.264 / H.265 / AV1 bitstream parsers are the one piece of this repository
carrying third-party patent exposure, and this is a GPLv3 tree. With the option
off, `src/video/` is neither compiled nor linked and every consumer falls back
to an external ffmpeg: the GUI says why in the dataset panel, and `spirula sam
video` / `extract` say so and exit. See `cmake/SsOptions.cmake` and
`docs/build.md`.

Turning it on buys roughly 15x faster frame extraction (a 127-second 1080p30
clip in ten seconds), masking that rides along on the same device pass, and no
ffmpeg to install.

## What a `CodecDecoder` is for

A hardware decoder does entropy decoding, motion compensation and filtering. It
does **not** track reference-picture state, and Vulkan makes that the
application's job. So per coded frame the codec layer produces:

* the bitstream the driver should see — Annex-B for H.264/H.265 (3-byte start
  codes; NVIDIA's H.265 slice-header parser assumes that prefix length at the
  offsets it is handed), the frame's OBUs for AV1;
* the `StdVideo*` picture-info structure;
* which DPB slot the picture activates and which slots it references.

The three implementations differ in where that state lives, which is why they
share an interface rather than code:

- **H.264** mutates its DPB in place: sliding-window or MMCO marking, with POC
  types 0/1/2 all in play. `H264Decoder.cpp`
- **H.265** rebuilds the reference picture set from scratch for every picture,
  so most of that file is `st_ref_pic_set()` and the POC bookkeeping around it.
  `H265Decoder.cpp`
- **AV1** has no parameter-set NAL units at all: quantization, segmentation,
  loop filter, CDEF, loop restoration, tiling and global motion are re-sent in
  every frame header, and each has a StdVideo struct to fill. That file is a
  complete section-5.9 frame-header parser. `Av1Decoder.cpp`

AV1 also puts several coded frames in one temporal unit — one shown frame plus
the hidden alternate references it was predicted from — so a packet can yield
several pictures (`PictureInfo::more_in_packet`), and `show_existing_frame`
re-outputs a picture decoded earlier, which is why pool images are pinned while
a DPB slot still names them.

## Two decode output layouts

`VkVideoDecodeCapabilitiesKHR` reports one of two arrangements and both are
implemented:

- **DISTINCT** — the driver writes a standalone output image alongside the
  reference it sets up. Nothing more to do.
- **COINCIDE** — the decode target *is* the DPB slot, which is what NVIDIA
  reports for H.264 and H.265. The picture then has to be copied out before that
  slot is recycled, so `recordDecode` appends a `vkCmdCopyImage` (one region per
  plane; multi-planar images cannot be copied with a COLOR aspect) after
  `vkCmdEndVideoCodingKHR`. About 30 µs at 1080p.

## Queues

Decoding runs on the video-decode queue family with its own command pool and
timeline semaphore; the conversion runs on the compute queue through the normal
`vk::Stream`. Output images are created `VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT` across the
two families so no ownership transfer is needed, and `Stream::waitOn` attaches
the decode's timeline value to the next compute submission.

Two things bear repeating:

1. **`vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR` binds resources; the decode operation activates
   slots.** The picture being reconstructed is therefore listed with
   `slotIndex = -1`. Passing its real slot index is a validation error until
   some earlier decode has activated it — which is not the case the first time
   around.
2. Layout transitions for the pool images happen on whichever queue is about to
   use them, with `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT` on both sides. A video
   queue supports very few pipeline stages; ALL_COMMANDS is always legal.

## The entry-point table lives one device, not one process

`video_api()` resolves `VK_KHR_video_*` through `vkGetDeviceProcAddr`, and the
table it hands out is valid **only for the device it was resolved from**.
`nn::shutdown()` is not a process-exit hook — the GUI calls it after every
dataset job to hand the 2 GB of segmentation weights back — so a second video
open runs on a second device, and a table cached for the life of the process
then points at loader trampolines that were unmapped with the first one. The
symptom is a segfault in an unnamed frame under `createSession`, one open too
late to look like a lifetime bug.

So the table is keyed on `vk::Context::generation()` and re-resolved when that
changes. Anything else that caches device-derived state across a `shutdown()`
owes the same check; `vk::Stream` and `vk::Pipelines` instead drop their whole
`Impl` and re-initialise lazily, which is the other valid answer.

## Why frames are handles

`VideoPipeline::next()` returns a `FrameHandle`, not an image. Decoding and
*using* a frame are separate because the caller that motivates this — picking
the sharpest frame of every window — should not pay to convert and download the
frames it discards. Pixels are touched only when `queueSharpness()` or
`toImage()` ask for it, and the handle keeps the picture alive until released.
Presentation order needs a reorder queue anyway, so the pool and the explicit
release are not extra machinery.

The pool is sized `max_reorder + lookahead + max_dpb_slots + 4` pictures. At 4K
that is a few hundred megabytes, which is the price of holding a blur-selection
window in decoded form rather than re-decoding it.

## Colour

`color_matrix()` folds bit depth, studio/full range and the BT.601/709/2020
coefficients into one 3×4 matrix, so the shader has a single code path. Chroma
is box-averaged over the same source footprint as luma rather than bilinearly
interpolated; against ffmpeg's `swscale` that is worth a maximum error of about
3/255 on a 1080p frame, all of it at chroma edges.

Film grain synthesis is parsed but not requested (`apply_grain = 0`). It is a
cosmetic post-process, the frames feed a segmentation model, and asking for it
would force the distinct-output path on drivers that would rather not.
